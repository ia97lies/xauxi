{"name":"xauxi","tagline":"reverse proxy","body":"### Welcome to xauxi.\r\nxauxi is a event driven reverse proxy. The configuration is a Lua script. In the configuration you have full access to the connection/request/response including the body data. It is easy to write own plugins to manipulate request, response and data. It is possible to write plugins either in Lua or C/C++.\r\n\r\nXau xi is vietnamese and stands for ugly. The idea is to solve standard use cases with a simple configuration but also be able to handle realy nasty situations. For example handle test clients or monitors different to normal user. It would be even possible to inject a configuration by authentication service, for example user specific settings bound to the users role.\r\n\r\nXauxi is currently based on LuaNode a very fun and greate project. It seems to be much more performant than node.js or luvit.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\nBeta\r\n\r\n### Prerequisit Ubuntu\r\n```\r\n#Install Lua and libraries\r\nsudo apt-get install lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev luasocket-dev\r\n#Install OpenSSL\r\nsudo apt-get install libssl-dev\r\n#Install Boost\r\nsudo apt-get install libboost1.49-dev libboost-system1.49-dev\r\n#Get lualogging\r\nsudo luarocks install lualogging\r\n#For integration testing\r\nsudo apt-get install httest\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Build Instructions\r\n```\r\ncd $HOME\r\nmake workspace\r\ncd workspace\r\ngit clone git://github.com/ignacio/LuaNode.git LuaNode\r\ncd LuaNode/build\r\ncmake ../\r\nmake\r\ngit clone git@github.com:ia97lies/xauxi.git\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nluanode executable can be found $HOME/workspace/LuaNode/build/luanode\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n```\r\napt-get install httest\r\n```\r\n\r\nCorrect the paths in config/config.sh\r\n\r\nMake/generate everything and start all tests\r\n```\r\ncd xauxi\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting xauxi by hand\r\n```\r\nluanode server/proxy/conf/xauxi.lua\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nSee example directory for sample configurations.\r\n\r\n### Future Plan\r\nHave one make/script to generate/build all needed stuff as much self contained as possible\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nProject started 2013 by Christian Liesch (@ia97lies)\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\n[Apache Licence Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
