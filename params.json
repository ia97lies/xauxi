{"name":"xauxi","tagline":"reverse proxy","body":"### Welcome to xauxi.\r\nxauxi is a event driven reverse proxy. The configuration is a Lua script where you have full access to the connection/request/response including the body data. It is easy to write own plugins to manipulate request, response and data. It is possible to write plugins either in Lua or C/C++.\r\n\r\nXau xi is vietnamese and stands for ugly. The idea is to solve standard use cases with a simple configuration but also be able to handle nasty situations.\r\n\r\nXauxi is currently based on LuaNode a very fun and greate project and seems to be much more performant than node.js or luvit.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\nBeta\r\n\r\n### Make it work\r\n#### Prerequisit\r\nAll example and checked in configs expect a $HOME/workspace so the first thing is do\r\n```\r\ncd\r\nmkdir workspace\r\ncd workspace\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen checkout xauxi\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:ia97lies/xauxi.git\r\n```\r\nOr download a release from github and extract it \r\n```\r\ncd xauxi\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Ubuntu\r\nOn ubuntu system run the follwing script in the xauxi folder\r\n```\r\n./ubuntu.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Red Hat\r\nOn a red hat system run the follwing script in the xauxi folder\r\n```\r\n./redhat.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Others\r\nAll others try to run ./generic.sh and resolve conflicts by hand\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\nYou need a [httest](https://sourceforge.net/projects/htt/) to run all tests.\r\n```\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nSee example directory for sample configurations.\r\nTo start a example configuration you have first set the package path and include xauxi/lib there then you can start it\r\n\r\n```\r\nluanode examples/simple.xauxi\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Future Plan\r\n - Full fledge SSL support for front and backend connection\r\n - A REST debugger interface to tackle configuration problems\r\n - Gzip plugin\r\n - Redis integration to store session\r\n - Bullet proof error handling - currently the poxy terminates on error, is ok for development but not for production settup\r\n - Websockets tunneling\r\n - Authentication plugin\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nProject started 2013 by Christian Liesch (@ia97lies)\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements #\r\nI'd like to acknowledge the work of the following people or group:\r\n\r\n - Ignacio Burgueno, for [LuaNode](http://ignacio.github.com/LuaNode)\r\n - Danilo Tuler and Thiago Ponte, for http://neopallium.github.com/lualogging/\r\n - Paul Kulchenko, for serpent\r\n\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\nMIT Licencse\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
