{"name":"xauxi","tagline":"reverse proxy","body":"### Welcome to xauxi.\r\nxauxi is a event driven reverse proxy. The configuration is a Lua script where you have full access to the connection/request/response including the body data. It is easy to write own plugins to manipulate request, response and data. It is possible to write plugins either in Lua or C/C++.\r\n\r\nXau xi is vietnamese and stands for ugly. The idea is to solve standard use cases with a simple configuration but also be able to handle nasty situations.\r\n\r\nXauxi is currently based on LuaNode a very fun and greate project and seems to be much more performant than node.js or luvit.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\nBeta\r\n\r\n### Prerequisit Ubuntu\r\n```\r\n#Install Lua and libraries\r\nsudo apt-get install lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev luasocket-dev\r\n#Install OpenSSL\r\nsudo apt-get install libssl-dev\r\n#Install Boost\r\nsudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-system-dev\r\n#Get lualogging\r\nsudo luarocks install lualogging\r\n#For integration testing\r\nsudo apt-get install httest\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Build Instructions\r\n```\r\ncd $HOME\r\nmake workspace\r\ncd workspace\r\ngit clone git://github.com/ignacio/LuaNode.git LuaNode\r\ncd LuaNode/build\r\ncmake ../\r\nmake\r\ngit clone git@github.com:ia97lies/xauxi.git\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nluanode executable can be found $HOME/workspace/LuaNode/build/luanode\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n```\r\napt-get install httest\r\n```\r\n\r\nCorrect the paths in config/config.sh\r\n\r\nMake/generate everything and start all tests\r\n```\r\ncd xauxi\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting xauxi by hand\r\n```\r\nluanode server/proxy/conf/xauxi.lua\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nSee example directory for sample configurations.\r\n\r\n### Future Plan\r\n - Have one make/script to generate/build all needed stuff as much self contained as possible\r\n - Full fledge SSL support for front and backend connection\r\n - A REST debugger interface to tackle configuration problems\r\n - Gzip plugin\r\n - Redis integration to store session\r\n - Bullet proof error handling - currently the poxy terminates on error, is ok for development but not for production settup\r\n - Websockets tunneling\r\n - Authentication plugin\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nProject started 2013 by Christian Liesch (@ia97lies)\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements #\r\nI'd like to acknowledge the work of the following people or group:\r\n\r\n - Ignacio Burgueno, for [LuaNode](http://ignacio.github.com/LuaNode)\r\n - Danilo Tuler and Thiago Ponte, for http://neopallium.github.com/lualogging/\r\n - Paul Kulchenko, for serpent\r\n\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\nMIT Licencse\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
