{"name":"Xauxi","tagline":"event driven lua based reverse proxy","body":"### Welcome to xauxi.\r\nxauxi is a event driven reverse proxy based on Lua. The configuration is in fact a Lua script. You have full access to the connection/request/response including the possible body data. As http is just a Lua filter which is feed by the connections incomming data it is possible to handle any kind of protocol.\r\n\r\n### Sample configuration\r\nA sample configuration could look as follow\r\n```\r\nhttp = require \"http\"\r\n\r\n-- Frist simple proxy configuration \r\nfunction global()\r\n  listen(\"localhost:8080\",\r\n    function(connection, data)\r\n      http.filter(connection, data, function(r, buf)\r\n        if http.location(r.uri, \"/foo\") then\r\n          say(200, \"hit 1 /foo location\")\r\n        elseif http.location(r.uri, \"/bar\") then\r\n          say(200, \"hit 1 /bar location\")\r\n        else\r\n          say(404, \"404 Not Found\")\r\n        end\r\n      end)\r\n    end)\r\n  go()\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Version\r\nCurrently it is alpha vesion. No offical tar/zip available. Just checkout the git repo and explore the test cases and code.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nCurrently only plain TCP is supported. I will first get a feeling for the configuration and the code before introducing SSL.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nProject started 2013 by Christian Liesch (@ia97lies)\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\nApache 2 licence\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
